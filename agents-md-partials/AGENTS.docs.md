## Docs Style

Compact, high signal to noise write descriptions optimized for an engineer-to-engineer dialogue.

- Be concise. Prefer short sentences and direct statements.
- Focus on actionable information. Avoid filler, marketing, and verbosity.
- Use plain language and concrete terms.
- Keep sections small; remove anything nonessential.
- Use bullets for quick scanning; avoid long paragraphs.
- Favor commands/examples over prose.
- State assumptions explicitly when needed.
- Avoid redundancy.
