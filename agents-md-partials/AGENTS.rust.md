## Rust Core Principles

## Code Edit Workflow
After making code changes, run `cargo check` to verify the code compiles without warnings
Fix any warnings before considering the task complete.

### Clarity Beats Cleverness
Readable, explicit code is preferred over compact or “smart” code.
Use descriptive names over short ones
Prefer match over deeply nested if chains
Avoid overly generic abstractions unless reuse is proven
Optimize for the next human (or agent) reading this code.

### Small, Testable Units
Prefer small functions with narrow responsibility.
One function = one job
Pure functions when possible
Add unit tests for behavior, not implementation
If it’s hard to test, it’s probably doing too much.
